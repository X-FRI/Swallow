## Build & Install

To build and run with [xmake](xmake.io):
> Setup: Install the [xmake](xmake.io), [flex]() and [bison]()
  
- To build:   xmake build
- To run:     xmake run
- To install: xmake install

## Introduction

### Typechecking
```rescript
data Bool = [ True, False ]
data List = [ Nil, Cons Int List ]

let main(argv) = {
    match argv with {
    | True => { 0 }
    | Nil => { 1 }
    }
}
```

```
[E013] Error: Type checking failed for pattern
    /-[example/PatternType.sw]
    o
  6 |      | True => { 0 }
  7 |      | Nil => { 1 }
    o        ^^^^        
    o        := This pattern has type 'List', but here may need a 'Bool'
  8 |      }
    o
    o-- Note: 'Bool' conflicts with 'List'
----/
```

### Pattern Matching
```rescript
data List = [ Nil, Cons Int List ]

let main(argv) = {
  match argv with {
  | Nil => { 0 }
  | Cons x xs => { 0 }
  }
}
```
